# AMD Catalyst Firmware Extractor

A plug-in for Binary Ninja, written in Rust. It does what the name suggests.

The AMD Catalyst Firmware Extractor project is licensed under the `Thou Shalt Not Profit License version 1.5`. See `LICENSE`.

The address selected must have a name, and it is used for the file name. The plug-in will prompt you with a (native) file dialogue of where to save it.

Note that this is designed for semi-modern versions of the proprietary Catalyst drivers, aka 2015+ ones.
